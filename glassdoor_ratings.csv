People are regularly “managed out” and any issues are dealt with passive aggressively instead of directly. 

Nothing can be discussed in confidence. Every “private” meeting you have, be it with management or HR, will be discussed with other employees. It’s a return to a high school social structure including popularity contests, gossip, and sucking up to get a “good grade”.

It’s an easy job because you’re not held accountable for your actions. Did you spell the client's name wrong and run ads for an entire year while never once looking at it and racking up $20k in spend? No worries! Your manager will just blame the Account Manager or client. 

Work laptop that you can take home. Kind of nice but you have to give it back when you’re fired or figure out you’re too good for G/O.","Work Relay - the task/project management system. Someone decided it would be a fantastic idea to fire all the Project Managers, probably because they didn’t know what they did, and get this fancy new “automated” system for managing tasks and projects. The problem is, the people developing the new system never worked in the old one and didn’t quite understand the fulfillment process. It is full of bugs. You can’t organize your tasks. Sometimes you can enter all your information into a task and when you try to save it, it just deletes it (fun!). Tasks are also automatically assigned to it is impossible to gauge workload from a manager's perspective. But that really doesn’t matter because managers have no idea what the process is. But they’ve invested literally millions of dollars into it so they’re never gonna give it up and admit their mistake.

Management. They used to be good. And I have no idea what happened in the last year+ to make things so bad. I think the problem is is that they don’t manage. They want so badly to be your friend and don’t know how to be a manager. There is no constructive feedback, ever. Everything is fine until you make a mistake that they can’t sweep under the rug and then you’re micromanaged until you eventually quit. But you can push your limits pretty far until there is any sort of punishment. I saw an employee literally HIT a manager and it was never reported and nothing happened. Management also has fallen pretty out of touch with the product so that makes giving feedback hard too. Can’t really develop your employees if you don’t know what’s going on with your product. 

Empty promises. They love to talk about career development and all the wonderful things you can do at the company but 99% of the time, that never happens. Their mindset is that you should do the job (for an undetermined amount of time) before you’re even considered for a promotion. Which I somewhat agree with but there needs to be follow up. Not just do the job until “Finance” says they have the budget to promote someone. I saw an employee do a job test for a month and never got feedback. That’s because management thought he was too valuable at his current position to even consider moving him to a different department. Don’t believe all the talk, they’re not going to actually promote you. Sorry.

Being at the mercy of the markets. G/O is under the company Tegna which has sales teams/markets all over the country that sell all the products Tegna offers, G/O Digital being one of them. G/O has a set of rules aka deliverables which dictates what is offered in a product. Those are supposed to be set but they’re more or less a light suggestion at this point. All they have to do is threaten to cancel and they’ll get whatever they want. Want to change your ads every few days for no good reason? DONE. Decide you want multiple goals even though you’re thousands of dollars under the threshold? DONE. It would be one thing if it was the actual client wanting these changes but 95% of the time its the sales teams playing specialist and thinking they know what’s best. The DCSMs need to do a better job managing these relationships and not letting the specialist get walked all over. Also, let them cancel and stand up for once. These accounts are already mad if they’re threatening to cancel. Odds are you’re going to spend more in paying your employees to meet their demands than what they’re actually spending. Ever hear of service creep? Big problem here.","Start over. 

I liked most of the managers as people but they aren’t qualified to run teams. They were never taught how to manage and it shows. 

DEVELOP YOUR PEOPLE. If you’re not a self starter, you will hate G/O. You have to teach yourself the job and how thing work. Actually use the training team to help the specialist. And I don’t mean phone training.

If you are talented and good at your job, you will be under appreciated and undervalued.

Also, if you are looking to move your career upwards, G/O Digital is not the place for you. Managers and presidents seem to encourage giving false promises to their employees looking to move up, or sabotaging any lateral movement within the company. Their new thing appears to be rolling out new career paths but not actually opening up jobs to move up those career paths.","Tegna needs to just start over with this place. In my time with the company, almost every talented employee I saw at the company in fulfillment moved on. It's not hard to quickly see why. Their CEO, Tim Fagan, is very proud of finally turning a profit after only having to lay off almost half of the company and their entire inside sales team in 2017. Future layoffs are coming as soon as Gannett takes its email accounts back, which I believe is supposed to happen this summer. He has not run a successful 

Because so many talented specialists have left, if you are competent, your team leads will catch on quickly and throw a massive workload on to you. You may manage a book of 80+ accounts because of your proficiency while other specialists struggle with a few dozen, but it's fine because the job is so mindless. The lack of creativity allowed in all departments is stifling, and managers are terrified to try unique and creative processes, new tools, different strategies and more if it falls out of the build standardization. Oh, and you may be asked to take on extra work while your team lead is literally coloring while on the clock and showing pictures off to her (and your) manager for praise, or managers leave at 4:30 for happy hour even though their team is still working on project they assigned.

Tegna has wisely started monitoring this company to trim all of the excess fat so G/O doesn't actively cost them money in the future. Luckily, this should be an easy fix, as the company employs dozens of middlemen called account managers. They get paid more than fulfillment specialists, and receive all of the bonuses for renewals (and not the fulfillment specialists who actually make the account run successfully). All they have to do is copy and paste emails from sales reps in markets, and then copy and paste the fulfillment specialists responses. It's the job to get at the company if you HAVE to work here. Maybe Tegna will see this and realize that if they hired a few more fulfillment specialists in each department, they would likely have the bandwidth to be client/sales rep facing.

If you are fresh out of college, I suppose you could do worse than G/O for your first job IF you are a self-motivator and willing to train yourself, as the lack of training is staggering. Employees train each other, so latch on to the one good specialist left in each department, learn everything you can as fast as you can, and then get out before you get too far in. The longer you stay, the more you realize how much better other agencies are. But if you are an experienced digital marketer, you will not (and should not) last long. I have seen specialists get hired and leave a week or two later, and most of the ""good hires"" (who get hired with experience) are out in a few months at most.

2017-08-23,Anonymous,,Former Employee,The K-Mart of Digital Marketing,8,"- Hires young, enthusiastic people who are very friendly. Even the CEO will greet you when he's in town.

- Work/life balance. While some days are more packed than other, many people are able to finish their tasks for the day fairly quickly making it a pretty stress-free environment. 

- Benefits are decent and company is flexible. They have health, vision, dental and 401K. They have even brought in advisors to help with additional questions. If you need time off or an occasional work from home day, they’re usually pretty accommodating – depending on your rapport and relationship with your manager. Because of traffic, they have a flexible start time i.e. you can come in anywhere between 6:30 a.m. to 8:30 a.m. and adjust your leave time accordingly. The one rule is you cannot leave before 3:30 p.m. without talking to your manager about it beforehand. Also, it's in a great location downtown with access to a parking garage 24/7. That comes in handy for a lot of people.

- Great Culture. They regularly had company-sponsored happy hours in the office, a great holiday party at the end of the year and themed days especially when comic-con was in town so people could have a chance to win tickets.

- If you are brand new to the industry, you can get a lot of work samples quickly in a place like this. Also, I found those that were serious about evolving in specific aspects of digital marketing tended to turnover rather quickly, but those that were good with process and general ideas moved up pretty quickly to management opportunities. It all depends on what your goals are for if this will be a good fit for you.

- Plenty of opportunities to find and start a new project to help boost your skills/knowledge in whichever area you choose. When the industry makes major changes the company cannot ignore, the company looks to their natural leaders to take charge and implement those changes seamlessly. If you can spot these opportunities, and you’re a go-getter who’s good at networking internally, this can work in your advantage. 

- When faced with a major layoff, recently, upper management cut quite a few people based on numbers alone. However, I will give them credit that they did try their best to place these people with work/options post layoff. They also gave this group a 60-day notice and a severance package – based on specific parameters. However, that’s not always the case on how they handle lay off situations. A couple months prior to that, they had to lay off the entire sales department and several other folks in various departments. They didn’t give those people advance notice, at all, but I believe they still received some sort of severance package.

- Caring management team. The company does a pretty good job at hiring managers who still have compassion in them. Most management was internally promoted which helps with process but hinders the company on advancing in the industry – there are a few exceptions to the rule, but very few. However, I definitely have never had a manager care more about my personal well-being than at G/O digital. 

- Continued opportunities to make extra cash. For certain departments, the company will host a lot of sales competitions giving you the opportunity to make a little extra cash for upsells and cross sales. However, this was primarily for the client services team. Nevertheless, there is an excellent referral program to get you some extra cash, and an internal awards program that not only makes you feel recognized for your accomplishments but comes with an extra $50 or $100 if you win.","- Every product/service is outdated and limited by an outdated process. The company restricts you from being able to do basic marketing tactics like A/B testing. Recently, the social ads released a “big update” which included doing different URLs for a set of static ads and allowing all package levels to do geographic radius targeting. The company is spending a lot of time catching up and not a lot of time understanding how to be profitable. 

- SEO Product doesn't usually work. The team recently (launched June 2016) updated the product to more closely align with Google's Hummingbird update (released 2013). However, the new product doesn't include a link acquisition strategy, update onsite content (they create content on a blog page hosted on your site if you have one already or can install it otherwise they push you to a ""web 2.0"" or off-site blog like Wordpress that doesn't always link back to your website, boost trustworthy authority, fix website architecture, or improve social sharing (i.e. they do post to your social pages, but act more as a broadcast channel assuming you’ve already built your own audience. The reporting metrics are based off their proprietary system and allows very little insight into how the website is performing i.e. no data comparing desktop to mobile specifically, no traffic acquisition report, no content efficiency report for specific pages/pieces of content, no keyword analysis report (as a part of their talking points, they try to avoid keywords in general), no breakdown of visitors beyond number of sessions, and all of their reporting is generalized into one website vs. per page. Additionally, your AM is likely not going to have a lot of experience with SEO, and you’re not going to get a lot of specifics addressed for your questions especially if you’re looking at Google Analytics. 

- Search Advertising, their primary service/product, is limited. The company uses PPC on the search network and display network, primarily. If you’re looking to do shopping ads, you’re either going to be a T1 client spending at least $10,000 / month or go somewhere else. Sorry small business eCommerce sites and those wanted to learn all of Adwords capabilities. Also, if you’re looking to understand cost per acquisition or Return on Ad Spend, you’re not likely going to get it here. The team focuses on click / CTR data. So in short, it’s a good place to learn PPC if you have no experience at all, but if you’re even at a basic level, you’re not going to advance your knowledge much here.

- Slow to change and overly process oriented. The team leads and management have pretty set processes and “standard operating procedures”. The internal teams do not always work the greatest together to find solutions that best fit their customer’s needs especially if it goes against SOP. I often felt like I was fighting against the internal teams instead of collaborating because “that’s not the G/O way”. Also, they have set SLAs for every task with fulfillment. This is great for task management for the fulfillment team to plan ahead, but you need to be a strong person if you want to be an AM. It’s going to take a lot out of you to explain why a simple change like adding in a few negative keywords will take 3-5 days. Also, there is a disconnect between pre-sales and post-sales. Often times, the first thing you need to do is reset expectations because you're not sure what the pre-sales team told them, but it's no where near what is actually going to work / what you're even capable of doing at this spend level. This disconnect comes in with lack of communication between these departments and digital marketing training for the pre-sales team.

- Ambiguous Performance Evaluations. The company has annual reviews set in place with criteria each employee in various positions needs to meet in order to qualify for a bonus and/or a pay increase. This would be fantastic if it wasn’t for the fact that the criteria is pretty ambiguous when you really analyze it. You get plenty of feedback from your manager, but each department is only allotted to give a certain amount to their team. So the percentage distribution isn’t always fair especially if you are only a fairly even team. For example, if everyone on your team was equal, they would give each person a 3-star rating and a 2% raise (using that as a hypothetical), but if there was one stand out, the stand out could get a 5-star rating and a 3% raise while everyone else would be dropped to a 2 or 1% to accommodate. To some, this way seem pretty standard, but the criteria for a stand out doesn’t always mean highest producing based on pre-set qualifications. It may mean that person was more tenured in that department. This could negatively impact you if you were promoted early on in the year, and therefore not as tenured to that department by the end of it. Additionally, your direct report manager does your annual review, but if the company needs to do a lay-off, they do not even consult your direct report manager before handing out unemployment packages. If the company is going to hit another downturn, which is very possible, do not expect to take comfort that your manager will be able to save you. Chances are, they’re as in the dark as you are.","Study up! This company lacks serious mentors in the digital marketing space.

The company enjoys hiring younger folks with little to no experience. As far as I know, college degrees aren't required for many roles. Although they do a sub par job of training, there is some training that can position you to succeed.

Fast-paced environment.

A lot of young, fresh-out-of-school and like-minded people.

It's an okay place to get an overall foundational level view of what an agency in digital marketing does.

Benefits are decent and there's a good culture if you block out the politics.

I met some good folks for referrals that allowed me to get out early when I saw the writing on the wall.","You will NOT learn anything beyond the very basics at G/O Digital. There is zero effort made at the company to innovate or become an industry leader in any regard. If you accept a position at G/O Digital, stay only until you've fulfilled your own professional growth goals and be on your way. Staying longer will only make you less competitive in the job market down the road.

G/O Digital rarely acquires new business through word of mouth, great reviews, or overall excellent products/service. The main source of business is through the ARMY of sales people who are one day selling coupon slots in their local paper then the next day a $20,000+ website. The sales tech knowledge is abysmal and if you are client/sales-facing you'll encounter incredible struggles on several fronts.

The management, upper management, and senior levels have absolutely no idea what they're doing to run a digital agency. I'm not just being over-dramatic: they have been laying off tons of people because management is driving the company into the ground and the hardworking people doing client work are paying for it.

The CEO, Tim Fagan, is 100% to blame for this failing company (likewise the TGNA CEO/Board for keeping him), as he hires people no where near capable of running their departments. He's a nice guy, funny, gets to know people, etc. but is horrid at what he does. I believe he's been with the parent company (who is definitely NOT digital marketing) his entire career. This industry is nearly free money and they can't even turn a profit.

Nepotism runs rampant. People get hired or promoted who have no business doing what they're doing.","Please just resign and let someone who is more qualified and knowledgeable lead the young and eager teams. Your poor decisions through lack of true agency and media experience only induce stress and frustration to those who work so hard only to get laid off.

There are little, if any, experienced management and senior leadership folks capable of taking the company beyond low hanging fruit clients. Management spends more time putting out fires of unhappy clients than growing the company, growing their teams, and improving quality.",2.0,4,2,3,3,1,,cross,cross

It is saddening to see them reporting into such an incompetent ""leadership"" team.",Tim Fagan the CEO is really a moron. He doesn't know what he's doing and even the most junior employees know it. It is clear that his bosses at TEGNA are equally inept since they haven't cut bait and thrown this idiot out on his butt.,Fire Tim Fagan. He should be flipping burgers somewhere. Certainly not running G/O Digital. Sell the company to someone who is capable of running it. Clearly you have failed.,1.0,3,2,1,1,1,,cross,cross
