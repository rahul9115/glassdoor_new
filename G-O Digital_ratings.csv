People are regularly “managed out” and any issues are dealt with passive aggressively instead of directly. 

Nothing can be discussed in confidence. Every “private” meeting you have, be it with management or HR, will be discussed with other employees. It’s a return to a high school social structure including popularity contests, gossip, and sucking up to get a “good grade”.

It’s an easy job because you’re not held accountable for your actions. Did you spell the client's name wrong and run ads for an entire year while never once looking at it and racking up $20k in spend? No worries! Your manager will just blame the Account Manager or client. 

Work laptop that you can take home. Kind of nice but you have to give it back when you’re fired or figure out you’re too good for G/O.","Work Relay - the task/project management system. Someone decided it would be a fantastic idea to fire all the Project Managers, probably because they didn’t know what they did, and get this fancy new “automated” system for managing tasks and projects. The problem is, the people developing the new system never worked in the old one and didn’t quite understand the fulfillment process. It is full of bugs. You can’t organize your tasks. Sometimes you can enter all your information into a task and when you try to save it, it just deletes it (fun!). Tasks are also automatically assigned to it is impossible to gauge workload from a manager's perspective. But that really doesn’t matter because managers have no idea what the process is. But they’ve invested literally millions of dollars into it so they’re never gonna give it up and admit their mistake.

Management. They used to be good. And I have no idea what happened in the last year+ to make things so bad. I think the problem is is that they don’t manage. They want so badly to be your friend and don’t know how to be a manager. There is no constructive feedback, ever. Everything is fine until you make a mistake that they can’t sweep under the rug and then you’re micromanaged until you eventually quit. But you can push your limits pretty far until there is any sort of punishment. I saw an employee literally HIT a manager and it was never reported and nothing happened. Management also has fallen pretty out of touch with the product so that makes giving feedback hard too. Can’t really develop your employees if you don’t know what’s going on with your product. 

Empty promises. They love to talk about career development and all the wonderful things you can do at the company but 99% of the time, that never happens. Their mindset is that you should do the job (for an undetermined amount of time) before you’re even considered for a promotion. Which I somewhat agree with but there needs to be follow up. Not just do the job until “Finance” says they have the budget to promote someone. I saw an employee do a job test for a month and never got feedback. That’s because management thought he was too valuable at his current position to even consider moving him to a different department. Don’t believe all the talk, they’re not going to actually promote you. Sorry.

Being at the mercy of the markets. G/O is under the company Tegna which has sales teams/markets all over the country that sell all the products Tegna offers, G/O Digital being one of them. G/O has a set of rules aka deliverables which dictates what is offered in a product. Those are supposed to be set but they’re more or less a light suggestion at this point. All they have to do is threaten to cancel and they’ll get whatever they want. Want to change your ads every few days for no good reason? DONE. Decide you want multiple goals even though you’re thousands of dollars under the threshold? DONE. It would be one thing if it was the actual client wanting these changes but 95% of the time its the sales teams playing specialist and thinking they know what’s best. The DCSMs need to do a better job managing these relationships and not letting the specialist get walked all over. Also, let them cancel and stand up for once. These accounts are already mad if they’re threatening to cancel. Odds are you’re going to spend more in paying your employees to meet their demands than what they’re actually spending. Ever hear of service creep? Big problem here.","Start over. 

I liked most of the managers as people but they aren’t qualified to run teams. They were never taught how to manage and it shows. 

DEVELOP YOUR PEOPLE. If you’re not a self starter, you will hate G/O. You have to teach yourself the job and how thing work. Actually use the training team to help the specialist. And I don’t mean phone training.

If you are talented and good at your job, you will be under appreciated and undervalued.

Also, if you are looking to move your career upwards, G/O Digital is not the place for you. Managers and presidents seem to encourage giving false promises to their employees looking to move up, or sabotaging any lateral movement within the company. Their new thing appears to be rolling out new career paths but not actually opening up jobs to move up those career paths.","Tegna needs to just start over with this place. In my time with the company, almost every talented employee I saw at the company in fulfillment moved on. It's not hard to quickly see why. Their CEO, Tim Fagan, is very proud of finally turning a profit after only having to lay off almost half of the company and their entire inside sales team in 2017. Future layoffs are coming as soon as Gannett takes its email accounts back, which I believe is supposed to happen this summer. He has not run a successful 

Because so many talented specialists have left, if you are competent, your team leads will catch on quickly and throw a massive workload on to you. You may manage a book of 80+ accounts because of your proficiency while other specialists struggle with a few dozen, but it's fine because the job is so mindless. The lack of creativity allowed in all departments is stifling, and managers are terrified to try unique and creative processes, new tools, different strategies and more if it falls out of the build standardization. Oh, and you may be asked to take on extra work while your team lead is literally coloring while on the clock and showing pictures off to her (and your) manager for praise, or managers leave at 4:30 for happy hour even though their team is still working on project they assigned.

Tegna has wisely started monitoring this company to trim all of the excess fat so G/O doesn't actively cost them money in the future. Luckily, this should be an easy fix, as the company employs dozens of middlemen called account managers. They get paid more than fulfillment specialists, and receive all of the bonuses for renewals (and not the fulfillment specialists who actually make the account run successfully). All they have to do is copy and paste emails from sales reps in markets, and then copy and paste the fulfillment specialists responses. It's the job to get at the company if you HAVE to work here. Maybe Tegna will see this and realize that if they hired a few more fulfillment specialists in each department, they would likely have the bandwidth to be client/sales rep facing.

If you are fresh out of college, I suppose you could do worse than G/O for your first job IF you are a self-motivator and willing to train yourself, as the lack of training is staggering. Employees train each other, so latch on to the one good specialist left in each department, learn everything you can as fast as you can, and then get out before you get too far in. The longer you stay, the more you realize how much better other agencies are. But if you are an experienced digital marketer, you will not (and should not) last long. I have seen specialists get hired and leave a week or two later, and most of the ""good hires"" (who get hired with experience) are out in a few months at most.

2017-08-23,Anonymous,,Former Employee,The K-Mart of Digital Marketing,8,"- Hires young, enthusiastic people who are very friendly. Even the CEO will greet you when he's in town.

- Work/life balance. While some days are more packed than other, many people are able to finish their tasks for the day fairly quickly making it a pretty stress-free environment. 

- Benefits are decent and company is flexible. They have health, vision, dental and 401K. They have even brought in advisors to help with additional questions. If you need time off or an occasional work from home day, they’re usually pretty accommodating – depending on your rapport and relationship with your manager. Because of traffic, they have a flexible start time i.e. you can come in anywhere between 6:30 a.m. to 8:30 a.m. and adjust your leave time accordingly. The one rule is you cannot leave before 3:30 p.m. without talking to your manager about it beforehand. Also, it's in a great location downtown with access to a parking garage 24/7. That comes in handy for a lot of people.

- Great Culture. They regularly had company-sponsored happy hours in the office, a great holiday party at the end of the year and themed days especially when comic-con was in town so people could have a chance to win tickets.

- If you are brand new to the industry, you can get a lot of work samples quickly in a place like this. Also, I found those that were serious about evolving in specific aspects of digital marketing tended to turnover rather quickly, but those that were good with process and general ideas moved up pretty quickly to management opportunities. It all depends on what your goals are for if this will be a good fit for you.

- Plenty of opportunities to find and start a new project to help boost your skills/knowledge in whichever area you choose. When the industry makes major changes the company cannot ignore, the company looks to their natural leaders to take charge and implement those changes seamlessly. If you can spot these opportunities, and you’re a go-getter who’s good at networking internally, this can work in your advantage. 

- When faced with a major layoff, recently, upper management cut quite a few people based on numbers alone. However, I will give them credit that they did try their best to place these people with work/options post layoff. They also gave this group a 60-day notice and a severance package – based on specific parameters. However, that’s not always the case on how they handle lay off situations. A couple months prior to that, they had to lay off the entire sales department and several other folks in various departments. They didn’t give those people advance notice, at all, but I believe they still received some sort of severance package.

- Caring management team. The company does a pretty good job at hiring managers who still have compassion in them. Most management was internally promoted which helps with process but hinders the company on advancing in the industry – there are a few exceptions to the rule, but very few. However, I definitely have never had a manager care more about my personal well-being than at G/O digital. 

- Continued opportunities to make extra cash. For certain departments, the company will host a lot of sales competitions giving you the opportunity to make a little extra cash for upsells and cross sales. However, this was primarily for the client services team. Nevertheless, there is an excellent referral program to get you some extra cash, and an internal awards program that not only makes you feel recognized for your accomplishments but comes with an extra $50 or $100 if you win.","- Every product/service is outdated and limited by an outdated process. The company restricts you from being able to do basic marketing tactics like A/B testing. Recently, the social ads released a “big update” which included doing different URLs for a set of static ads and allowing all package levels to do geographic radius targeting. The company is spending a lot of time catching up and not a lot of time understanding how to be profitable. 

- SEO Product doesn't usually work. The team recently (launched June 2016) updated the product to more closely align with Google's Hummingbird update (released 2013). However, the new product doesn't include a link acquisition strategy, update onsite content (they create content on a blog page hosted on your site if you have one already or can install it otherwise they push you to a ""web 2.0"" or off-site blog like Wordpress that doesn't always link back to your website, boost trustworthy authority, fix website architecture, or improve social sharing (i.e. they do post to your social pages, but act more as a broadcast channel assuming you’ve already built your own audience. The reporting metrics are based off their proprietary system and allows very little insight into how the website is performing i.e. no data comparing desktop to mobile specifically, no traffic acquisition report, no content efficiency report for specific pages/pieces of content, no keyword analysis report (as a part of their talking points, they try to avoid keywords in general), no breakdown of visitors beyond number of sessions, and all of their reporting is generalized into one website vs. per page. Additionally, your AM is likely not going to have a lot of experience with SEO, and you’re not going to get a lot of specifics addressed for your questions especially if you’re looking at Google Analytics. 

- Search Advertising, their primary service/product, is limited. The company uses PPC on the search network and display network, primarily. If you’re looking to do shopping ads, you’re either going to be a T1 client spending at least $10,000 / month or go somewhere else. Sorry small business eCommerce sites and those wanted to learn all of Adwords capabilities. Also, if you’re looking to understand cost per acquisition or Return on Ad Spend, you’re not likely going to get it here. The team focuses on click / CTR data. So in short, it’s a good place to learn PPC if you have no experience at all, but if you’re even at a basic level, you’re not going to advance your knowledge much here.

- Slow to change and overly process oriented. The team leads and management have pretty set processes and “standard operating procedures”. The internal teams do not always work the greatest together to find solutions that best fit their customer’s needs especially if it goes against SOP. I often felt like I was fighting against the internal teams instead of collaborating because “that’s not the G/O way”. Also, they have set SLAs for every task with fulfillment. This is great for task management for the fulfillment team to plan ahead, but you need to be a strong person if you want to be an AM. It’s going to take a lot out of you to explain why a simple change like adding in a few negative keywords will take 3-5 days. Also, there is a disconnect between pre-sales and post-sales. Often times, the first thing you need to do is reset expectations because you're not sure what the pre-sales team told them, but it's no where near what is actually going to work / what you're even capable of doing at this spend level. This disconnect comes in with lack of communication between these departments and digital marketing training for the pre-sales team.

- Ambiguous Performance Evaluations. The company has annual reviews set in place with criteria each employee in various positions needs to meet in order to qualify for a bonus and/or a pay increase. This would be fantastic if it wasn’t for the fact that the criteria is pretty ambiguous when you really analyze it. You get plenty of feedback from your manager, but each department is only allotted to give a certain amount to their team. So the percentage distribution isn’t always fair especially if you are only a fairly even team. For example, if everyone on your team was equal, they would give each person a 3-star rating and a 2% raise (using that as a hypothetical), but if there was one stand out, the stand out could get a 5-star rating and a 3% raise while everyone else would be dropped to a 2 or 1% to accommodate. To some, this way seem pretty standard, but the criteria for a stand out doesn’t always mean highest producing based on pre-set qualifications. It may mean that person was more tenured in that department. This could negatively impact you if you were promoted early on in the year, and therefore not as tenured to that department by the end of it. Additionally, your direct report manager does your annual review, but if the company needs to do a lay-off, they do not even consult your direct report manager before handing out unemployment packages. If the company is going to hit another downturn, which is very possible, do not expect to take comfort that your manager will be able to save you. Chances are, they’re as in the dark as you are.","Study up! This company lacks serious mentors in the digital marketing space.

The company enjoys hiring younger folks with little to no experience. As far as I know, college degrees aren't required for many roles. Although they do a sub par job of training, there is some training that can position you to succeed.

Fast-paced environment.

A lot of young, fresh-out-of-school and like-minded people.

It's an okay place to get an overall foundational level view of what an agency in digital marketing does.

Benefits are decent and there's a good culture if you block out the politics.

I met some good folks for referrals that allowed me to get out early when I saw the writing on the wall.","You will NOT learn anything beyond the very basics at G/O Digital. There is zero effort made at the company to innovate or become an industry leader in any regard. If you accept a position at G/O Digital, stay only until you've fulfilled your own professional growth goals and be on your way. Staying longer will only make you less competitive in the job market down the road.

G/O Digital rarely acquires new business through word of mouth, great reviews, or overall excellent products/service. The main source of business is through the ARMY of sales people who are one day selling coupon slots in their local paper then the next day a $20,000+ website. The sales tech knowledge is abysmal and if you are client/sales-facing you'll encounter incredible struggles on several fronts.

The management, upper management, and senior levels have absolutely no idea what they're doing to run a digital agency. I'm not just being over-dramatic: they have been laying off tons of people because management is driving the company into the ground and the hardworking people doing client work are paying for it.

The CEO, Tim Fagan, is 100% to blame for this failing company (likewise the TGNA CEO/Board for keeping him), as he hires people no where near capable of running their departments. He's a nice guy, funny, gets to know people, etc. but is horrid at what he does. I believe he's been with the parent company (who is definitely NOT digital marketing) his entire career. This industry is nearly free money and they can't even turn a profit.

Nepotism runs rampant. People get hired or promoted who have no business doing what they're doing.","Please just resign and let someone who is more qualified and knowledgeable lead the young and eager teams. Your poor decisions through lack of true agency and media experience only induce stress and frustration to those who work so hard only to get laid off.

There are little, if any, experienced management and senior leadership folks capable of taking the company beyond low hanging fruit clients.

1. Management is a loose term used for the people who are overpaid to delegate tasks they have no understanding of while not charging a dime for it. They like to point fingers when something is wrong and take credit when something is right. Despite the fact that this should be flipped. 

2. There isn't an ounce of professionalism or industry knowledge to be found in the robotic minds of these people. It's truly mind-blowing that they have managed to keep the business going as long as it has. I would attribute this to preying on small business owners who just found out that the internet exists last week. 

3. If you are friends with the boss you will do great here! You will get promoted or hired based on that fact alone and not your actual skill set. If you work hard and actually know what you're talking about you will be shunned and spoken poorly of behind your back...even though common sense should tell them that your many co-workers will hear the words about you and themselves. 

4. The only way to get a bonus is to suck up to your boss as much as possible. 

5. Management idea of refining processes is to copy and paste the old ones into a new wiki page each month and completely ignore them when they want something done immediately...which is always. 

6. Finally, neither HR or management felt the need to let the Web Department know that its demise was coming despite what I assume was months and months of knowing it was going to happen. Way to value that your employees are actually humans, G/O. 

Essentially, this job was a good way for me to make friends but it taught me nothing except that sometimes your superiors are gossiping liars who care about nothing except getting ahead and putting others down.

Might also be a good place to pad your resume for a recent graduate, though many entry level positions went filled by for-profit college grads or people without legitimate university education. That could be a pro for some.

I did feel that I was able to learn a substantial amount about digital marketing, enough to enable me to leave G/O Digital.","At my time of leaving:

Severely below average compensation (you'll make more driving Uber compared to most of the fulfillment roles here).

Poor benefits overall.

General mismanagement (especially middle and upper-middle).

Overarching feeling of disconnection between client-facing and fulfillment roles, including enmity between departments.

Laughable performance review process, especially with their maximum annual raise percentile unable to keep up with inflation and cost of living adjustments. This was a large factor in my leaving, as it felt like I was being punished for trying to be loyal and stick around when so many other people were leaving. (I worked here for over a year and at one point had the longest tenure in my department, to speak to the amount of turnover at G/O.)

Often tedious and at many times anachronistic work being performed for client accounts. 

An overall disingenuous undertone from senior leadership, especially with regard to quarterly fiscal goals that outpaced the production and efficiency targets that, in general, were pretty consistently met by the rest of the company. In light of Gannett's acquisition of ReachLocal it seems doubtful this will improve.

Front line people are often left to fend for themselves and battle over who will help meet deadlines when everyone is already swamped. Due to high turnover accounts are constantly transferred around. If you're the go-to person you are rewarded by getting the problem accounts and tougher workload but no raise.

Annual raises are so low they are borderline insulting and do not keep up with the cost of living. Also, they are pro-rated for new hires.

The medical benefits are terrible. Very high deductible before insurance pays anything ($1600 I think?) so I basically have to pay 100% of all my doctor visits. They have 10 free teledoc appointments, but sometimes I have to see a doctor. 

Excessive overtime is the norm. Everyone is so burnt out they have a hard time making conversation.

While the company doesn't pay much on the health insurance they offer multiple options and benefits that you could choose from.,"The Outside Sales position was the most abused by the company and those people who were unfortunate enough to be hired into the job were left to die a slow death due to the absolute incompetence of the Regional Managers, where answers were few and far between along with throwing the sales reps under the bus as often as deemed appropriate to keep their jobs... shameful and disgusting is the only way I can describe it. There was a consistent and all knowing feeling of ""alone-ness"" as you slogged through your day attempting to use the ridiculously poor lead database that G/O had as a tool to get business. 

The inner working of the company were so ridiculously bureaucratic that when you would sell, a program(s) to a company you not only felt somewhat frightened at the thought you knew you'd just hurt that business because the company was so slow at implementing the various programs AND you knew the trouble for you had just started. This company just despises it's sales force to the point I felt it every time I turned in a deal they'd come up with any number of bureaucratic methods to either tell you it wasn't approved or some other stupid detail you'd have to jump through just to ""submit"" or in our case ""re-submit"" signed agreements. It was more nerve wracking knowing what you were in for after a client signed than getting a client to sign!! 

The company had something like 10-11 VP of whatever so when you'd walk the halls they'd all be thumbing their noses at you like you were scum and it was always uncomfortable knowing this. A company that size should never have more than 2 VP's and just showed how self-adsorbed the parent company (Tegna) was with itself and the disconnect between what they thought of themselves and what the reality was to the average prospect they were attempting to sell through to was huge. No one outside the company walls cared less about them and that made selling very hard, not to mention the incompetence of managers and their complete lack of ""backing the troops"".

The company went through so many strategic changes over the time I worked there that no one recognized or even knew what to do to the point it was a laughing joke among us all. They paid a high base so as a result commission were gawd awful and I knew many reps that would wait months to get paid on closed and even paid programs because they had not ""launched"" yet, this after payment was made in full - particularly for website development. The cancel rate for clients was so high you never really got to enjoy the residuals as the client would catch wind of the incompetent roll-outs and poor marketing and just cancel after the 4 month minimum, something close to 60-80% would cancel in the first 6 months making any forward progress for Regional Account Executives mute and unobtainable.","Hey get your heads out of your ivory tower and look around you. You're struggling to make ends meet because you have too many chiefs and not enough true contributors. Your sales people are the ONLY ones that matter, not the VP's or so called strategic planners, that quite frankly have done you more harm than good! You need to terminate the Regional Managers and get strong leaders that are more interested in doing the right thing by their sales people than covering their own butts on a daily basis. But truth be told, it really starts at the top. The CEO would walk around and blah blah about ""culture"" all day, guess what, you don't have a culture you have failure, that's all so the CEO should be the first to go.

You will be stuck in the same role for years if you are not actively scouring for opportunities and you more than likely will have to completely change departments in order to advance because those above you either can't move up or refuse to move up. The company is not competitive in the market when it comes to pay, benefits, or product/service. The company likes to release processes and tools without making sure they either work as expected or are actually fully functional. While the company says they want your ideas, they will simply take your ideas, throw them in a box and lock them away in a dark closet never to be heard or seen of again. Communication is terrible within teams and even worse cross department, which causes confusion and an all-around unpleasant experience day-to-day.

I know the company is still trying to get everything figured out, but with the disorganization, poor communication, no professional opportunity, and little incentive to actually want to work hard for the company, I would not recommend working for G/O Digital.","You really need to pay more attention to the employees actually doing all the work for the company.

Gated parking lot employees can use any time.","Far too many middle men involved in the process of trying to build a technical product. Direct client access is SO important in producing things correctly, but Ignorant salespeople stand in the way of people who actually know what they're doing. The people with the technical know-how have no access to the people they are actually trying to build products for. The tech people cannot educate the clients and steer them away from bad decisions that will lead to ineffective products because they have no access. Sales reps sometimes encourage bad decision making just to get things over with. They will not hesitate to throw fulfillment staff under the bus for something that was their own fault.

Some sales reps have no idea what they are selling. They sometimes mislead the client into thinking they are going to get something they haven't paid for. We have very clear cut product tiers so I just don't even know how that is possible except out of sheer ignorance. Building these products takes a lot of time and technical know-how and cannot be done for free just so a sales rep can avoid looking bad for making a mistake. 

Effective communication is completely impossible. Every project is like a game of telephone - messages from the client have to go through a sales rep, and then a project manager - none of which know what they're talking about - before finally getting to the person that needs it. And by then, the message has been skewed or lost. 

Extremely 'Turn and Burn' atmosphere. Volume and revenue is the only thing that matters to upper management, leaving fulfillment staff extremely overburdened and overwhelmed with a work load that is impossible to handle. Some don't even have time to answer the phone. Everyone is stressed out daily. Many clients get poor experience as a result and are not treated well. There's a lot of corner-cutting just to get things live on time. 

Morale is very low. Most people in fulfillment are very talented and knowledgable about the products they are creating. But working in this dysfunctional environment is very soul-crushing, and most people get apathetic and just give up. You get the sense that no one else cares if something is done right or not. It's always someone else's problem. I honestly feel like working at G/O has made me worse at my job because I am no longer challenged or motivated to learn. 

G/O wants to be seen as an agency, but they will never, ever be that. The client base is not interested in a creative, unique solutions - they just want cheap products that do the bare minimum and that is all G/O is capable of.","Cut the sales reps out of the fulfillment process so we can actually educate our clients and get some good work out the door.

They seem unconcerned about the concerns of the team, and when complaints and suggestions were brought up, they were ignored or labeled as 'insobordination' for undermining management and questioning their tactics, when in fact, we just wanted to help.

I've been a part of some awesome projects, sales councils, management training etc. I feel that I am a better person for working here at G/O Digital. I feel like I got my MBA in start ups with all the initiatives, deadlines, strategy sessions etc. Since the new CEO has taken over, they have made great strides to flatten out the organization and have seen some great strides made internally between sales and operations. 

Their base pay is usually 1.5x what the competition is willing to pay.","The Bad: The sales process is really over engineered. G/O struggles to push account live in a timely fashion (especially when compared to our direct competition). Just spoke about new CEO leadership, only problem is that it took them a really long time to make those changes. How patient do they expect us to be? 

Not a performance based organization. Since they have so much wrapped up in your base pay, you really have to knock it out of the park to get paid commission. To complicate matters even more, their comp plan is based on 'go live' and since it takes an exorbitant amount of time to get products live (like I said earlier), you really have to stack your deck and line everything up properly to get paid out on the higher tier percentages.","The Ugly: People don't leave companies, they leave managers. They are so disconnected from the front lines that it's comical. When your hand picked leaders are telling you exactly what they need in the field to get better results from their sellers, you would think that would be important feedback. There is a whole lot of 'Do this because I said so' not a whole lot of 'Do this, here's why and here is how.'

2014-10-21,Senior Software Developer,"Phoenix, AZ","Current Employee, less than 1 year",Fast-paced software development in an SEO project,7,"Close-knit group, good team chemistry, going out to lunch together every day, no legacy technologies in use, current Microsoft development products, great computers to develop with","Close quarters work area with no windows and when one person gets sick the whole team gets sick. Very high turnover rate where either developers get sick the moment they see the complete mess that is their code-base (several stories of new hires resigning before their first day was done) or get frustrated with the lack of documentation/structure, or clash with management. In my time working there, 6 developers have quit (from a development team that numbers around 12 to 14 people).

So committed to 9-day sprints that important corners get cut and constructive criticism trends to get trivialized during the sprint retrospectives (a popular quote they've grown fond of is from LinkedIn founder/CEO ""first get it out and then get it right"" and perfectly reasonable requests for up-front business requirements, descriptions of tasks, or for the need to have a solid design phase prior to embarking on complicated coding tasks all got shot down).

Cowboy-coding at its finest: severely unstructured with no enforcement of coding standards or documentation, environment is extremely hostile to Entity Framework and the database administration department can be a bit anti-C# at times (seeing it as more of a pass-through between the Javascript framework implementing the MVC pattern and the database side implementing all of the business logic), not a good environment at all for C# development. 

An awkward mix of some technologies such as AngularJS front-end with ASP.NET server-side (they committed to it for so long they've accumulated a massive code-base, but are now deciding to rewrite in traditional ASP MVC with razor views but will probably lure an ASP MVC developer in the door without telling them they'll have to extract everything from a massive Angular code base)

Management can be a tad aloof, passive aggressive, and unwilling to give out encouragement on a job well done.","Be humble enough to admit you have some problems so you can get on the road to fixing them, not just trying to pump in fresh bodies.",2.0,3,4,4,3,1,,cross,line
2014-11-02,Regional Account Executive,,"Former Employee, less than 1 year",Run... Don't walk! If you are a serious sales consultant...,7,Can't think of any... not even one.,"1. Let's start with 'benefits' - There is ONE insurance plan to 'choose' from. Yes, you read that correctly. Not only do you have ZERO CHOICES for insurance plans, but they have the nerve to call the ONE option they give you, the 'choice' plan. It's as if they're purposefully being sarcastic with the name. Now... about this 'choice' plan: United Health Care with a a $1500 DEDUCTIBLE before ANYTHING is covered. Everything health related including a quick trip to the doc, is OUT OF POCKET UNTIL YOU have paid $1500 out of pocket. The monthly payment for '1' is around $220 and nearly $500 for a family. That means you have to spend approx $2500+ as an individual PLUS the initial $1500 PER YEAR, For each family member, they also have the same deductible; it is not combined. Now, after you have paid in the first $1500, from that point they pay 80/20. Same for each of your kids and spouse. Since generally it will take the average person all year to reach this, and likely you won't, basically you pay in all year to the tune of approx $2500 - $5000 in payments PLUS each persons deductible of $1500 EACH, only to RE-SET at the end of the 12 month period and again, you'll have to reach $1500 before even a basic doctor visit or simple prescription is covered. And they have the nerve to call this a 'benefit.' 

2. Utter confusion. My role was as an outside sales rep so once I sold a 'product' to an advertiser, it was then 'supposed' to then be managed by a so-called 'Account Manager.' If you are reading this posting, you are likely seeking a sales/business development role and can probably understand how if you are to build a nice clientele base that it is pretty important that once you make a sell to a client, that they stick around long term... otherwise, getting paid on a client for 1 or 2 months is pointless and not worth all of the time you put in up front to get them in the first place. Here's where the issues come into play... almost everything I ever sold churned right out the door once the so-called 'Account Manager' took over. These 'Account Managers' are nothing more than teenagers fresh out of college (if that) who literally do nothing but screw up on a regular basis... CONSISTENTLY. They are too young to be in 'Account Management' roles and are sold to be 'born and bred' on the internet which translates to nothing more than 'spent most of their entitled lives up this point chattering aimlessly about unimportant mindless dribble with their friends on the same platforms that small/medium business now advertise on' like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. How their being able to 'chat' on these platforms equates to being capable of leveraging these platforms strategically to grow some unsuspecting small business successfully, I have no idea. My very first sale, right out of the gate was a Deal Chicken deal.... no one knew what was going on... no one told me what to do... it was literally just feeling around in the dark and hoping I get it right. Luckily I figured it out but from there, every other sale I had in my limited time with this company, went badly from the beginning. The Account Mangers didn't respond to my calls, left me hang, went on vacations constantly, were always out of the office, couldn't answer questions accurately and on and on and on. It was like talking to an 18 year old about fractional reserve lending or something... they didn't 'get' it. It was painfully clear from the beginning that any clients I brought on board were going to be short runs and churn right away... I began looking for a job almost immediately after my 2nd sale and having the chance to go through the process and see what was 'under the hood' - I was mostly shocked at the fact that whoever was managing these yahoos still has a job. I mean, even one of the incidents I witnessed during my short run would have been grounds for 'firing' in all companies I've worked for in the past. It's just beyond irresponsible and incompetent how bad this team is... it's really that bad. The confusion caused by these inexperienced kids alone is enough to bring cause for a serious review.... I wasted far too much time trying to untangle messes this team made. 

3. The other big thing that had me running from this company is the upper management. They seem to think they have it all figured out but then make decisions that anyone could clearly see aren't in good business sense. If I were on the board of this company I would seriously consider firing all of them. Literally. They have been able to build what they have this far on the back of using the name 'USA Today' but that can only get them so far if their not going to do right by the clients they partner with... which brings me to my next point: 

4. The 'products' and teams managing them are laughable. I haven't seen any one sales rep yet that has had a long term client as a result of the fact that they simply don't get RESULTS for paying clients. They say they have teams that manage everything in-house yet the sales people are not allowed to interact with them at all... as far as we know they are little green men from outer-space. They have these irresponsible completely incompetent 'Account Managers' that stand between us and these illusory 'in-house' teams. Therefore, when something goes wrong... the only refuge is to babble back n forth with the 'Account Manager' until you just give up and let the account cancel and move on. They make it clear that this is business as usual for them and they make ZERO efforts to attempt to save a client who isn't happy. This makes it very difficult for a serious sales consultant to build a lucrative business. It also begs the question of whether or not these 'teams' are even in-house at all..... many have questioned whether or not they're even in the United States... 

5. Finally, the commission is a joke. Less than 5% if your on goal, which is around $40k/month. There is also no pay on renewals so there's no incentive for you to continue building the relationship with the client and grow the business. If/when they renew (which likely will never happen anyway so it's actually kind of a mute point), you get nothing. Zero. Nada. What a joke. 

6. This book has a beautiful cover but sadly, when you pull open the pages it's a completely different story... it's all smoke and mirrors and clients figure it out quickly and move on which leaves the sales execs in a constant state of stress and fire dousing. Not worth the pay and certainly not worth losing respect in your community with business owners who associate their bad experience with you in the end. Most of the reps I worked with are already gone or are searching for new jobs now... 

7. Finally, they hired more sales reps in my market than I was initially told. There were only supposed to be 2 of us... which was a lie. I've also heard that the manager has changed '3' times since I left... it's only been a couple of months...
